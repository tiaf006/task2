In This Task we used HTML,PHP and MySQL to build a website that has 5 buttons ( Forward, Backward, Left , Right and stop ) its used to move the robot base . When the user Click on Left button for example .The button name  will be save in the buttons database then the PHP code will fitch the last record inserted in the buttons database and display it on the PHP page. Finally, we convert this interface to mobile web view.
